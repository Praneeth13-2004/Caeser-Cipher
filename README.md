The code implements a simple Caesar Cipher using **Streamlit** for the user interface. At the core, there’s a function `caesar_cipher()` that takes text, a shift value, and a mode (either "encrypt" or "decrypt"). If the mode is "decrypt," the shift is negated so the text is shifted backwards instead of forwards. Each character in the input is checked: if it’s an alphabetic letter, it’s shifted within the bounds of uppercase or lowercase letters using ASCII values. Non-alphabet characters (like spaces, numbers, or punctuation) are left unchanged. This ensures that only letters are modified while everything else remains intact.

On the front end, Streamlit provides a clean and interactive interface. The app starts with a title and input fields where users can type in text, select a shift value (from 1 to 25), and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the text. When the "Run Caesar Cipher" button is clicked, the function processes the input text according to the chosen settings and displays the result. If no text is entered, a warning prompts the user to type something first. This makes the Caesar Cipher both educational and easy to experiment with through a simple, user-friendly interface.
